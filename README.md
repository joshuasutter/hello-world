# hello-world
My first repository!

I was born in Colorado and moved to Arizona in 2006. Currently, I work for a consulting company called Westland Resources. 
I like to camp, snowboard, and watch movies.
The project I am working on for this program is a database clean-up of an existing HOA database from a geospatial aspect.
